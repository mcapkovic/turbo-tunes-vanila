    song_lyrics: `Hiya, Barbie
Hi, Ken
You want to go for a ride?
Sure, Ken
Jump in
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on, Barbie, let's go party
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
I'm a blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly
You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
You can touch
You can play
If you say, \"I'm always yours\" (ooh, oh)
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again
Hit the town, fool around, let's go party
You can touch
You can play
If you say, \"I'm always yours\"
You can touch
You can play
If you say, \"I'm always yours\"
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
Oh, I'm having so much fun
Well, Barbie, we're just getting started
Oh, I love you, Ken`,

Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Ah, yeah, yeah

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time`,
